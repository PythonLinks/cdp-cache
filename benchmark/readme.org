* How to run
  
These benchmarks are borrowed from [[https://github.com/nicolasazrak/caddy-cache][here]] for comparision.

#+begin_src sh
  bash provision.sh
#+end_src

This will move the test data to the directory which will be served by Caddy. Then, run your caddy with the Caddyfile provided by benchmark.

#+begin_src sh
  caddy run --config [benchmark's Caddyfile]
#+end_src

** Plain to write some benchmarks to tuning the performance

#+begin_src sh
  go test -bench=. -benchmem -cpuprofile profile.out
  go tool pprof profile.out (in the interactive mod, you can type web to open a web interface to see the graph)
#+end_src
